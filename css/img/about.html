                    <h2>About the Founder</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Klevis Zaimi, the founder of InternBuddy. I created this platform because I understand the challenges of finding the right internship or job in today's competitive market. Initially, InternBuddy was designed as a personal tool to help me land my dream job. However, I soon realized its potential to assist students worldwide in their career pursuits. Born in Albania on July 7, 2005, I pursued Computer Science at London South Bank University. Since then, I've successfully secured multiple job offers using InternBuddy, proving its effectiveness. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to empower students and make the job search process more accessible and efficient for everyone.</p>
